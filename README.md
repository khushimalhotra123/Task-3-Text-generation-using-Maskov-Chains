# Text-Generation-with-Markov-Chains

This repository contains code and resources for generating text using Markov chains, a simple yet powerful probabilistic model. Markov chains are widely used for generating sequences of text by predicting the next item in the sequence based on the current state. This project provides a framework for building, training, and using Markov chains to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

## Introduction

Markov chains are a statistical model that represent the probability of transitioning from one state to another. When applied to text generation, Markov chains can produce surprisingly coherent sentences, making them a popular choice for generating text in chatbots, random text generators, and other applications. This repository offers a simple yet extensible implementation of text generation using Markov chains.

## Features

- **Simple Implementation**: Easily create and train Markov chains on any text dataset.
- **Customizable n-grams**: Choose the level of n-gram (e.g., bigram, trigram) to control the coherence of generated text.
- **Efficient Text Generation**: Generate large amounts of text quickly with minimal computational resources.
- **Example Scripts**: Ready-to-use Python scripts to generate text from different sources.
- **Well-Documented**: Clear and concise documentation to help you understand the implementation and modify it to suit your needs.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, clone this repository and use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text-Generation-with-Markov-Chains.git
cd Text-Generation-with-Markov-Chains
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start generating text by running the provided Python scripts or by following the examples in the Jupyter notebooks.

### Example Command

```bash
python generate_text.py --input_file data/input.txt --n_gram 3 --output_length 100
```

This command will generate 100 words of text based on trigrams (n=3) using the input text file.

## Examples

Here are some examples of text generated using this repository:

- **Bigram Example (n=2)**:
  ```
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
  ```

- **Trigram Example (n=3)**:
  ```
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, but the dog did not seem to care.
  ```

## Customization

- **Adjusting n-grams**: Modify the `n_gram` parameter to control how many words the model looks back at when predicting the next word. Higher n-grams produce more coherent text.
- **Training on Custom Data**: Replace the input text with your own dataset to generate text specific to your needs.
- **Post-Processing**: Add custom rules or filters to refine the generated text further.
